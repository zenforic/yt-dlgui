# yt-dlgui - A Rust GUI Frontend for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

## Building:
After installing [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), simply run in the root directory:

`cargo build` for the debug version or:
`cargo build --release` for the release optimized version.

The executables will be found in the target/debug (or release) folders. They can also be run with `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`

## Usage

Simply run the built executables (or from the latest Release) or the cargo run commands above. Simple usage is just entering the URL to download from and clicking download (Enter on your keyboard should work as well). an Advanced section exists for some common arguments as well as a manual arguments entry near the bottom for anything not in the Advanced section.
